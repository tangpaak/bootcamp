package Werewolfkill;

// In a werewolf game, the Board class would be responsible for managing the game state and displaying it to the players. Here are some possible components of the Board class:

// players field: This field would store a list of Player objects representing the players in the game.

// playerStatus field: This field would store a map of player names to their status (alive or dead).

// currentPlayer field: This field would store a reference to the current player whose turn it is.

// voteCounts field: This field would store a map of player names to their vote count.

// displayPlayers() method: This method would display a list of all the players in the game and their current status (alive or dead).

// displayRole(Player player) method: This method would display the role of a given player. For example, if the player is a werewolf, it would display "You are a werewolf."

// displayVoteCounts() method: This method would display the current vote counts for each player.

// handleVote(String playerName) method: This method would handle a vote by incrementing the vote count for the specified player.

// resetVotes() method: This method would reset the vote counts for all players to zero.

// handleNightAction(Player player) method: This method would handle the night action for a given player. For example, if the player is a werewolf, it would prompt them to choose a target player to
// attack.

// These are just some possible components of the Board class. Depending on the requirements of your game, you may need to add additional components and methods. The key is to think about the
// different responsibilities that the Board class has, and design its interface to support those responsibilities in a clear and maintainable way.
