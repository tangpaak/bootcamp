// Werewolf is a great choice for a turn-based game that you could design. Werewolf is a social deduction game where players are assigned secret roles as villagers or werewolves, and the goal is to eliminate the opposing team. Here's an outline of how you could design a simplified version of the game:

// Player class: This class represents a player in the game and has properties such as their name, role (villager or werewolf), and status (alive or dead).

// Role interface: This interface defines the common behavior for all roles in the game, such as the ability to vote or perform an action at night.

// Villager class: This class implements the Role interface and represents a villager in the game. Villagers have the ability to vote during the day to eliminate players they suspect of being werewolves.

// Werewolf class: This class implements the Role interface and represents a werewolf in the game. Werewolves have the ability to vote at night to eliminate villagers.

// Game class: This class manages the game state and handles player turns. It keeps track of the list of players, their roles, and their status (alive or dead). The Game class also has methods for starting a new game, handling player votes, and checking for win conditions.

// Board class: This class represents the game board and keeps track of the game state. It displays the current state of the game to the players and handles user input for voting or performing actions.

// You could extend this basic design with additional classes or features, such as special abilities or items that players can use to gain advantages during the game. Remember to think about the different objects and actions involved in the game, and how they can be represented using classes, interfaces, and abstract classes. Good luck with your game design!
